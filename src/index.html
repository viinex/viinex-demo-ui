      This is demo UI for some features of Viinex video management SDK.
      <p/>
      This demo uses Angular framework and requires modern features of your browser to be enabled.
      <p/>
      Please make sure you use up-to-date versions of Chrome or Firefox. Microsoft Edge and Safari 
      are also suitable. You'll need iOS 9 or later on Apple mobile devices.
      <p/>
      If the Angular-based UI does not load properly, you still may go to
      <a href="http://demo.viinex.com/x/index.html">http://demo.viinex.com/x/index.html</a>
